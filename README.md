## 📊 Key Findings
• Male respondents exhibit notably higher stress levels than females, highlighting potential differences in coping approaches and workplace pressures.

• The corporate population shows the strongest mental health impact, with elevated levels of stress, coping struggles, and mood swings — suggesting that occupational stress and performance demands play a major role.

• Students and homemakers also report significant coping challenges, indicating the need for stronger emotional and social support systems.

• Lifestyle and habit changes appear closely linked with mental health history, emphasizing how behavioral stability contributes to overall wellbeing.

• The duration of staying indoors shows only slight variation in stress levels, implying that isolation alone is not the key driver of stress — external pressures and life adjustments may have stronger influence.

• A large portion of participants remain uncertain about available care options and are reluctant to discuss mental health, indicating persistent stigma and awareness gaps.

• Regionally, respondents from the USA reported the highest levels of stress, followed by the UK, suggesting cultural or systemic differences in work-life balance and mental health awareness.

In summary, the findings underscore that stress and mental health challenges stem from a combination of occupational, lifestyle, and awareness-related factors rather than isolation alone.Addressing these issues through workplace wellness programs, student counseling initiatives, and public awareness campaigns can significantly improve mental health outcomes across populations.
